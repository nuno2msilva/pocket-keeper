# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow
# =============================================================================
# This workflow automatically deploys the Pocket Keeper app to GitHub Pages
# whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# FEATURES:
# - Dynamic base path: Works with any repository name automatically
# - PWA support: Service worker and manifest are correctly configured
# - Caching: Uses npm cache for faster builds
# - Node 20 LTS: Uses the latest LTS version of Node.js
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Go to your repository Settings > Pages
# 2. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
# 3. Push to main branch to trigger deployment
#
# The deployment URL will be: https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
